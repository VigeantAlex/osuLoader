# osu!Loader
Load osu! with patches using .NET's Reflection!

Allows you to switch custom servers on the fly without hosts file and blocks updates.

It usually works on the latest stable, beta/cuttingedge and fallback are incompatible!

Typically updating encrypted symbols take around 5-10 minutes for every osu! update.
